# FluentValidation.Blazor
An implementation of FluentValidation for use with Blazor

There are several different packages that adapt the popular FluentValidation library for use with Blazor, but upon testing each of these packages, 
bugs were discovered, or lack of support for certain features and the most recent version of FluentValidation (v.9.0 at this point in time).

This repository is an amalgam of two different packages, plus code from Steve Sanderson's 2019 blog post describing an initial attempt at 
integration of FluentValidation with Blazor.  I've also made attempt to tweak the code, introduce simpler C# syntax and handle a greater number of potential 
errors.  

The Samples folder contains a series of simple examples of how to use the package - it will be expanded as time allows.
